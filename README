=== This is the SCSI test suite ===

* Intro

This package contains a simple test suite for the SCSI commands.  It requires
the sg3_utils to issue scsi commands, and a SCSI device that does not contain
any valueable data.

* Usage

Just run ./check to run all tests on /dev/sdb.  Edit the code to change it
or create a config file (XXX: document the config file).

* Feedback and patches

Please send improvements to the test suite, general feedback or just
reports of failing tests cases to target-devel@vger.kernel.org.
